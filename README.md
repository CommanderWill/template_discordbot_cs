# C# Discord Bot Template

## Quality Warning
This bot template is the code from my first Discord bot, C# Project, and my introduction into OOP, The code quality is terrible. 

There is a chance that I rewrite it completely at a later point, but it is unlikely

## Credit
I had help from a from @edwardkopp to get stuff working and they told me I should learn OOP which helped alot

I used the discord.net documentation and stack overflow to learn how to do a range of stuff in the project
Docs: https://discordnet.dev/

## Using This Code
Feel free to use any code here, in general its not great, some of the best stuff is what I learned and took almost directly from Stack Overflow & the discord.net documentation.

If you use this project for any public project, it would be preferred if you credit this project.

I have removed the serverID file from this project, to add your own, make a file in the main directory called "server_id.txt" and every second line put the server IDs, I have this set so every first line I can put the names of each server

The token.txt is currently programmed to look in the directory of the user which is running the bot, you can change this if you would like.
